# PyTorch Session Fix Documentation Memory (2025-09-06)

## Summary
Updated runtime_install.sh to configure torch 2.5 compatibility:
- Removed separate PyTorch installation to prevent conflicts
- Updated flash-attention wheel to v2.7.0.post1 for torch 2.5 support
- Maintained Python 3.12 compatibility throughout installation process

## Changes Made
1. **runtime_install.sh:12** - Removed separate `pip3 install torch torchvision --break-system-packages` command
2. **runtime_install.sh:52** - Updated flash-attention wheel URL from v2.8.3 to v2.7.0.post1+cu12torch2.5cxx11abiFALSE-cp312-cp312-linux_x86_64.whl

## Rationale
- Container logs were showing torch version conflicts
- User requested torch 2.5 compatibility via requirements.txt
- Flash Attention wheel needed matching torch version
- Aligned with GOALS.md runtime installation approach (dependencies from requirements.txt)

## Impact
- Eliminated torch installation conflicts in container startup
- Ensured proper dependency resolution through requirements.txt
- Maintained compatibility with Python 3.12 environment
- Preserved Flash Attention performance optimizations

## Next Steps
- Test container startup to verify torch 2.5 installation
- Monitor container logs for any remaining dependency issues
- Document findings in JOURNAL.md
